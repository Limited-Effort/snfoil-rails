Description:
    Generates a new model with the default rails generator and attaches the associated SnFoil files

        - JSONAPI Serializer (app/serializers/foo_serializer.rb)
        - JSONAPI Deserializer (app/deserializers/foo_deserializer.rb)

    This will also create (ActiveRecord):
        - Model (app/models/foo.rb)
        - Migration (db/migrations/xxxxxxxxxxx_create_foos.rb)
        - Rspec (spec/models/foo_spec.rb)
